# KJJ Flashcards

This is the first solo project for Mod 2 at Turing School of Software and Design.
This is an application that allows a user to see questions, take guesses, see a final score, and see how long the round took them to complete. The game is played through the command line. This project demonstrates the benefits of utilizing TDD for your code.





## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. You should have 5 pending tests in your `Card` test file that show up.

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```
